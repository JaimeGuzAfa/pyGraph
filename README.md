# pyGraph
pyGraph is a fully capable, graphing calculator that is able to plot, linear and quadratic equations into a 36x36 plane. 
Unfortunately, thanks to the naiveness of Telmita, pyGraph only works in the Codehs, online Python 3 Graphics (Brython) editor, 
that apart from allowing a developer to code uncompilable that is unable to be tuned from any other place than CodeHs, is slower 
than a f*cking turnip. With that being said, Hector, Tonito (not a developer) and I wish you can enjoy looking at a complex, 
beautifully crafted, 751 line-long python program, that plots equations that people in 10th grade barely know how to on their own 
without desmos or Mr. Banks, that was somehow, not enough to convince Tonito that pyGraph was better than his unnamed, c*cky "Jeopardy", Program-game.
